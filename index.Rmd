## Bio

My name is Reese Shelon and I am a sophomore math major, concentrating in statisitcs. I think that throughout the course of this semester, my visualizations have steadily improved, as I have learned ways of eliminating bias through visualizations, as well as found ways of making them more accessible to a wider range of people. I hope you enjoy my data visualization gallery!
