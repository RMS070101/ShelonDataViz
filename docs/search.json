This one in specific is very aesthetically please as the yellow background goes well with the blue density plots, whilst the boxplots are also color coordinated by group. This relationship helps explore the distribution of test scores amongst three different groups. It is evident that the academic group tends to score more than all other groups as they have a higher mean and seem to have more large scores than all other groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSAT HEAT - This is a heatmap of the relationship between the SAT Math scores and the SAT Verbal scores. I do find that this graph is rather challenging to interpret, however it is unique and unlike any of the other graphs I have created throughout this course, hence why I am including it.\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "NFL Passing Research",
      "description": "I took a data set, which scraped information from the NFL's website regarding passing statistics in the NFL all the way from 2001 and up until the 2023-2024 season. This data set contains passing stats from 2350 different players throughout the past 20+ years. We look to explore certain relationships with regard to these passing stats\n",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\n\n\n\n\nWhilst working with this data, I realized that the passing statistics did not only include quarterback play, but rather any player who ever threw a pass from the year 2000 up until 2023. Obviously, this became problematic as several statistics were skewed by players who only had 1 pass attempt. Thus, I made a more concise data set which includes only players who started 75% of the games per season, as well as had over 1200 passing yards, as I thought that was a good way of determining starting quarterbacks throughout the years.\nThe first visualization at hand is the distribution of total passing yards per year throughout the entirety of the NFL.\n\n\n\nHere, we can see that the average passing yards per season has definitely increased since the early 2000’s, however, despite an extra game being added in the 2021 season (and on wards), the average passing yards per season still does not top that of the average passing yards per season in the 2010’s. We can also note the maximum passsing yards per season was the largest in 2011, and was close to getting beaten in 2013, however, since then, no one has gotten close. We can see this relationship more clearly in the following visualization.\n\n\n\nIn this plot, we can see more precisely what the maximum passing yards per season is, while also showing which players were the one’s to accomplish the feat. We note the dotted red line as a marker for when there was a major rule change (the change from a 16-game to a 17-game season). We see that from 2020 - 2021 there is almost an 1000 yard increase of maximum yards thrown. This makes sense as there is an additional game for all QBs to earn more yards. However, 2023 seems to be right on track with 2020. When I saw this , I was extremely surprised because I would expect passing yards to increase with an additional game in each season. After a little bit of pondering, I thought to explore the relationship between passing yards and rushing yards amongst quarterbacks. It is evident to most NFL fans that the quarterback position is completely changing. In the past, pocket passing quarterbacks such as Tom Brady, Drew Brees, and Peyton Manning saw a lot of success. However, now we see the importance of mobility amongst quarterbacks such as Lamar Jackson, Jalen Hurts, and Josh Allen. Now, we look to explore if this rise of mobility in modern day quarterbacks is having an effect on the passing statistics amongst quarterbacks.\nHere, we have 2 treemaps in which the size of the rectangle/square is representative of the proportion of yards within the last 22 years. We look to compare the passing yards of quarterbacks by year and rushing yards of quarterback by year to see if there seem to be any patterns or correlation.\n\n\n\nAfter looking at these two treemaps, we can see some sort of pattern. For example, we see that 2022 was the year with the second largest amount of rushing yards by quarterbacks, while it had one of the lowest amounts of passing yards within the last 22 years. Similar patterns follow suit with the years 2020 and 2023. This relationship further shows how the new modern mobile quarterback era may be affecting passing yards per season.\nIn order to delve even further into this relationship, I decided to split the quarterbacks into a two separate categories based on their in season statistics. A quarterback will be considered a ‘Mobile QB’ if they net at least 500 rushing yards and 5 rushing touchdowns. If they fail to reach these margins, they will be considered ‘Pocket Passers’. Of the 501 QB’s in our modified data set throughout the last 20+ years, we find that there are only 34 that are considered to be mobile, whilst 467 QB’s are considered to be ‘Pocket Passer’. The following visualization shows the individual distribution of ‘Pocket Passers’ and ‘Mobile QB’s’ over the years.\n\n\n\nHere, we can clearly see the surge in ‘Mobile QB’s’ throughout the last few years, while ‘Pocket Passers’ seem to be declining. This can definitely help explain why we are seeing a decrease in passing yards within the last few seasons.\nIn order to take a deeper look into the direct comparisons of certain Quarterbacks passing and rushing stats, I have provided an interactive plot in which the user can input a Quarterback who started 75% of a season throughout the years 2001-2023 and a plot will show their distribution of yards in both respective categories over the years. Users may choose to use this as a means of comparing stats among certain quarterbacks, or to see trends in the decrease of passing yards and increase in rushing yards amongst certain quarterbacks.\n\n\nNow, what exactly has all of this data shown us? Well, it is clear that passing production in the NFL is no where near what it was like from 2011-2016. One of the reasons why this may be is because of the sheer pocket passing quarterbacks that played during this era. If you look at the passing vs rushing stats for players such as Drew Brees, Tom Brady, Philip Rivers, Peyton Manning, etc… it is evident that they were the most prolific passers in the league, and rarely ever ran with the ball. Meanwhile, the prolific passers in the NFL in the more modern era seem to favor running the ball a little bit more. This is seen with quarterbacks such as Josh Allen, Jalen Hurts, Lamar Jackson, etc… We also established a surge of mobile quarterbacks in the more recent years, furthermore proving that rushing amongst quarterbacks is affecting the passing game in the NFL. Although this may not in turn be problematic for the NFL, it may have a long-term affect, such as making it harder for players to beat previous passing records. All-in-all, this data helped show that there indeed is a reason behind the decline in passing yards over the recent seasons, and several factors have to do with it.\n\n\n\n",

Then, I found a way to alter how long the spiral is (determining whether it fills the whole circle). I wanted to create a spiral that was dense in bright colors, hence the black background, and settled for a 3/4 spiraling circle.\n\n\n\nArtwork 3For this visualization, I fulfilled the requirement of using a visualization containing my universities [Bucknell’s] colors. I thought that this ‘smoke’ effect with orange and blue could look cool. My first draft consisted of only one orange and one blue. Later, I added another shade of each color, to add slightly more variation in the colors, while still achieving what was required.\n\n\n\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is one of the “common visualizations” that I created to show the relevance of the ‘ggrain’ package. I took a subset of the first 2000 rows of the diamonds library. I decided to dive into the relationship between the diamond cut, ranging from fair to ideal, and how many carat’s in the diamond. From this visualization, we can see a similar distribution of carat for good, very good, premium and ideal diamonds, while fair diamonds seem to be in their own category.\n\n\n\nThis is how you can show three separate visualizations in just one plot using ‘ggrain’. This plot gives a lot more information than a simple violin plot as it now shows the distribution of each specific point value, as well as information on the quartiles, median, and range. This visualization uses the same data and variables as the previous visualization. However, in this, you can confirm that good, very good, premium, and ideal diamonds have an almost identical median of .73 carats. Meanwhile, fair diamonds tend to have .95 carats\n\n\n\n",
