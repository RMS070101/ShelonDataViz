title: "Generative aRt"
description: |
  I was tasked to create three different Generative Art pieces. "Generative Art" often refers to algorithmic art in which artists use systems of chemistry, biologoy, mechanics and robotics, mathematics, tiling and much more. The instructions were rather broad, allowing for creativity.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(aRtsy)
```



```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(2)
art1 = canvas_petri(colors = colorPalette("tuscany1"), background = "black", dish = "pink", attractors = 50, iterations = 25, hole = 0.4)
saveCanvas(art1, filename = "art1.png")
art1

```

When creating this visualization I found that it resembles an eyeball, or petri-dish shape. 


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(100)
art2 = canvas_flow(color = colorPalette("retro3"), background = "black", lines = 2000, lwd = 0.25, iterations = 1000, stepmax = 0.01, outline = "none", polar = TRUE)
saveCanvas(art2, filename = "art2.png")
art2
```

When I first created this visualization, I had the spiral go all the way around. Then, I found a way to alter how long the spiral is (determining whether it fills the whole circle). I wanted to create a spiral that was dense in bright colors, hence the black background, and settled for a 3/4 spiraling circle. 


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(250)
custom_palette = c(colorRampPalette(c("blue", "darkblue"))(20), colorRampPalette(c("orange", "darkorange"))(20))
art3 = canvas_smoke(colors = custom_palette, init = 2000, shape = "bursts", algorithm = "minimum", resolution = 100)
saveCanvas(art3, filename = "art3.png")
art3
```

For this visualization, I fulfilled the requirement of using a visualization containing my universities [Bucknell's] colors. I thought that this 'smoke' effect with orange and blue could look cool. My first draft consisted of only one orange and one blue. Later, I added another shade of each color, to add slightly more variation in the colors, while still achieving what was required.
